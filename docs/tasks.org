* TODO Project Plan :: DREAM function prediction pipeline [80%]
** DONE Parse DREAM networks
   - DREAM networks consist of adjacency lists with proteins listed as
     nodes.
   - Need to decide how I'm going to load the networks for processing. 
   - I should keep the node names with their indices so it is easy to
     attach labels for scoring.
   - Ensure everything is *deanonymized*. Keep it simple.

** DONE Parse GO labels [33%]
We need to load the labels for the nodes. There should be a standard
way to keep the labels with the nodes to ensure that scoring is easy.
which labels are kept is another problem of concern. Currently,
I use all labels for the nodes and the labels are stored in the format

GO_LABEL1 PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 PROTEIN3 ..
GO_LABEL2 PROTEIN1 PROTEIN2 PROTEIN3 ..

*** TODO Decide on which labels to keep
*** DONE Load raw labels from FA file

** DONE Implement network denoising algorithm(s) [100%]
*** DONE Implement DSD denoising algorithm
*** DONE Implement identity denoising algorithm
*** DONE Implement NE denoising algorithm [66%]
**** DONE Reproduce scoring on raw butterfly network.
**** DONE Port over denoising algorithm.
**** TODO Implement zero handling strategy.
** DONE Implement scoring strategy
*** DONE k-fold cross validation algorithm

** TODO Create a program that takes in a graph, embedding -> functional labelling
   Does this based on the l2 distance induced by the embedding. DSD
   embedding. [[https://github.com/kap-devkota/Trimming_Functional/blob/master/src/Utils/dse_computations.py][Embedding Code]]: DSD embedding compute_X_normalized(...).
